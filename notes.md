# Todo

## Organize the src folder.

Create new folder: components
Create 2 new components: EmployeeCard and EmployeeList
Create simple CSS for both
Import and use multiple EmployeeCards inside EmployeeList
EmployeeList is the one we are _calling_ from the App

## Step 3

- Add props: name, role, department + two additional fields of your choice (e.g. start date and location)
- Pass props to multiple EmployeeCard instances in EmployeeList
- Add state to EmployeeCard: to manage the role, initialising it with the role passed as a prop.
- Add a role-change button

# Step 4

If the role _IS_ "Team Leader", change the role back to the original role (e.g. Developer)

If the role _ IS NOT_ Team Leader, set it to Team Leader

# Step 5

- Update Readme with overview of the App
- List core features with descriptions
- Include a simple usage guide
- Reflect on what you've practices
- Push your today's work to Github
